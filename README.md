# Readable
For the Readable project, you will build a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

### Getting Started

Checkout this [front-end] repo, install dependencies, then start the gulp process with the following:

```
> git clone https://github.com/StevenChou/Readable.git
> cd Readable/reactnd-project-readable-starter-frontend/
> npm install
> npm start
```

run
 http://localhost:3000/


Checkout this [back-end] repo, install dependencies, then start the gulp process with the following:

```
> git clone https://github.com/StevenChou/Readable.git
> cd Readable/reactnd-project-readable-starter-backend/
> npm install
> node server
```

run
 http://localhost:3001/


## Backend Server


## Using The Server

### Include An Authorization Header

All requests should use an **Authorization header** to work with your own data:

```js
fetch(
    url,
    {
        headers: { 'Authorization': 'whatever-you-want' }
    }
)
```

### API Endpoint

The following endpoints are available:

| Endpoints       | Usage          | Params         |
