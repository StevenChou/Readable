# Readable
For the Readable project, you will build a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

### Getting Started

Checkout this [front-end] repo, install dependencies, then start the gulp process with the following:

```
> git clone https://github.com/StevenChou/Readable.git
> cd Readable/reactnd-project-readable-starter-frontend/
> npm install
> npm start
```

run
 http://localhost:3000/


Checkout this [back-end] repo, install dependencies, then start the gulp process with the following:

```
> git clone https://github.com/StevenChou/Readable.git
> cd Readable/reactnd-project-readable-starter-backend/
> npm install
> node server
```

run
 http://localhost:3001/


## What You're Getting
```
+--public/
 |-- index.html - DO NOT MODIFY
 |-- favicon.ico - React Icon, You may change if you wish.
+-- src/
 +-- icons/ - Helpful images for your app. Use at your discretion.
  |-- add.svg
  |-- arrow-back.svg
  |-- arrow-drop-down.svg
 |-- App.js - This is the root of your app. Contains static HTML right now.
 |-- App.css - Styles for your app. Feel free to customize this as you desire.
 |-- App.test.js - Used for testing. Provided with Create React App.
 Testing is encouraged, but not required.
 |-- BooksAPI.js - A JavaScript API for the provided Udacity backend.
 Instructions for the methods are below.
 |-- index.js - You should not need to modify this file. It is used for DOM rendering only.
 |-- index.css - Global styles. You probably won't need to change anything here.
|-- .gitignore
|-- CONTRIBUTING.MD - Information about contributing to this repo.
TL;DR - Fork and clone your own version of this to use it.
|-- README.MD - This README file.
|-- SEARCH_TERMS.md - The whitelisted short collection of available search terms
for you to use with your app.
|-- package.json - npm package manager file. It's unlikely that you'll need to modify this.
```

Remember that good React design practice is to create new JS files for each component and use import/require statements to include them where they are needed.

## Backend Server

To install and start the API server, run the following commands in this directory:

* `npm install`
* `node server`

## Using The Server

### Include An Authorization Header

All requests should use an **Authorization header** to work with your own data:

```js
fetch(
    url,
    {
        headers: { 'Authorization': 'whatever-you-want' }
    }
)
```

### API Endpoint

The following endpoints are available:

| Endpoints       | Usage          | Params         |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| `GET /categories` | Get all of the categories available for the app. List is found in `categories.js`. Feel free to extend this list as you desire. |  |
| `GET /:category/posts` | Get all of the posts for a particular category. |  |
| `GET /posts` | Get all of the posts. Useful for the main page when no category is selected. |  |
| `POST /posts` | Add a new post. | **id** - UUID should be fine, but any unique id will work <br> **timestamp** - [Timestamp] Can in whatever format you like, you can use `Date.now()` if you like. <br> **title** - [String] <br> **body** - [String] <br> **author** - [String] <br> **category** -  Any of the categories listed in `categories.js`. Feel free to extend this list as you desire. |
| `GET /posts/:id` | Get the details of a single post. | |
| `POST /posts/:id` | Used for voting on a post. | **option** - [String]: Either `"upVote"` or `"downVote"`. |
| `PUT /posts/:id` | Edit the details of an existing post. | **title** - [String] <br> **body** - [String] |
| `DELETE /posts/:id` | Sets the deleted flag for a post to 'true'. <br> Sets the parentDeleted flag for all child comments to 'true'. | |
| `GET /posts/:id/comments` | Get all the comments for a single post. | |
| `POST /comments` | Add a comment to a post. | **id** - Any unique ID. As with posts, UUID is probably the best here. <br> **timestamp** - [Timestamp] Get this however you want. <br> **body** - [String] <br> **author** - [String] <br> **parentId** - Should match a post id in the database. |
| `GET /comments/:id` | Get the details for a single comment. | |
